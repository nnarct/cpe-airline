![CPE Flying Logo](client/src/assets/logo/logo.png)

Welcome to CPE Flying, the flight booking website designed as a final project for the "Database" class of CPE KMUTT sophomore students. Our team has worked diligently to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for simulating flight bookings. Please note that this is a simulated application and does not support real flight bookings. This README serves as a guide for the project evaluation process.

## Project Overview üìö

CPE Airline is an online flight booking website simulation that aims to provide users with an immersive experience of searching for flights and managing bookings. While you cannot make actual flight reservations, you can explore the functionalities of the application and familiarize yourself with the booking process. With secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and efficient booking management, we aim to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features üåü

- **Flight Search:** Simulate searching for flights based on preferred destinations, dates, and other preferences.
- **Booking Management:** Simulate managing flight bookings, including viewing, modifying, and canceling bookings.
- **Secure Authentication:** Create an account with secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to simulate protecting personal information.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Additional Libraries:** SweetAlert2, Moment.js

These additional libraries, such as SweetAlert2 for enhanced pop-up alerts and Moment.js for time and date formatting, contribute to the overall user experience and functionality of the application.

## Installation and Setup üöÄ

To run CPE Airline locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/nnarct/cpe-airline.git`
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the client. Open a terminal, navigate to the `client` folder, and run the following command:  `cd client npm install`
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the server. Open another terminal, navigate to the `server` folder, and run the following command:  `cd server npm install`
4. **Database Setup (Required):** CPE Airline requires a MySQL database to function properly. Please ensure that you have a MySQL database set up.
5. **Contact for SQL File:** To obtain the SQL file containing the necessary schema and data for the CPE Airline database, please reach out to the project leader (nannapat1551@gmail.com).
6. Import the SQL File: Once you have received the SQL file, import it into your MySQL database to create the required tables and data.
7. Start the client application. In the terminal where you are in the `client` folder, run the following command: `npm start`
8. Start the server application. In the terminal where you are in the `server` folder, run the following command: `npm start`
9. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Please note that the SQL file is required to run the application properly. Without it, the application will not function as expected.
